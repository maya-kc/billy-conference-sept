        Towards a Common-sense Theory of the Negative <em>Catuṣkoṭi</em> in the <em>MMK</em>

                In this paper, I attempt to offer an alternative reading of the negative <em>catuṣkoṭi</em> usages that aligns with our common sense while also capturing the argumentative role they serve in Nāgārjuna’s <em>MMK</em>. I first submit that we take the negative <em>catuṣkoṭi</em> as a subspecies of a pattern of argument found throughout the <em>MMK</em>, the pattern that I propose to refer to as the “dilemmatic negation.” This is the pattern where a thesis and a <em>paryūdasa</em> negation of the thesis are <em>prasajya</em>-negated in sequence to logically deduce the negation of a presupposition shared by the original thesis and its <em>paryūdasa</em> negation. For example, a random thesis,<br>
 
                I had a sandwich for lunch. (1st <em>koṭi</em>)<br>
                (∃x)(Lix&Sx)<br>
                and its paryūdasa negation,<br>
                
                I had something other than a sandwich for lunch. (2nd <em>koṭi</em>)<br>
                (∃x)(Lix&~Sx)<br>
                are <em>prasajya</em>-negated in sequence resulting in,<br>  
                
                I did not have a sandwich for lunch. (<em>prasajya</em> negation of the 1st <em>koṭi</em>)<br>
                ~(∃x)(Lix&Sx), or (∀x)(Lix→~Sx), in other words, if I had something for lunch, then it is not a sandwich.<br>
                and,
                I did not have something other than a sandwich for lunch. (<em>prasajya</em> negation of the 2nd <em>koṭi</em>)<br>
                ~(∃x)(Lix&~Sx), or (∀x)(Lix→Sx), in other words, if I had something for lunch, then it is a sandwich.<br>
                And from these <em>prasajya</em>-negations of the 1st and the 2nd <em>koṭis</em>, it necessarily follows that,<br>
                
                (∀x)~Lix, or ~(∃x)Lix, in other words, I didn’t have anything for lunch.<br>
                By discussing various examples from the <em>MMK</em>, I point out that although seldom noted in previous literature, this “dilemmatic negation” is a pattern of argument as common as the three-times argument and serves a similar function, and I submit that the <em>prasajya</em>-negations of the 3rd and the 4th <em>koṭis</em> are primarily meant to ensure the validity of this “dilemmatic negation” argument’s deduction of the negation of the shared presupposition. Lastly, I criticize recent theories of <em>catuṣkoṭi</em> proposed by Priest, Westerhoff, Rahlwes, and Jones.

                The fundamental principle of Madhyamaka metaphysics is the negation of intrinsic nature (svabhāva) with regard to all things, including emptiness, the true nature of reality. For this reason, this school of thought was often accused by its Buddhist (as well as non-Buddhist) opponents of advocating nihilism. The question of whether the Madhyamaka doctrine of the absence of intrinsic nature (niḥsvabhāva) entails some kind of nihilism, along with the more primary question of how to properly understand this doctrine, has long been at the center of contemporary scholarly controversy. <br>
                In this presentation, I do not intend to enter into the arguments regarding the nihilistic interpretation of the founder of the Madhyamaka school, Nāgārjuna’s refutation of svabhāva. Instead, I will examine the concept of niḥsvabhāva within the eighth-century Kamalaśīla’s system of thought. In the history of Indian Madhyamaka, Kamalaśīla occupies a special position in that he not only composed philosophical treatises elucidating and establishing the Madhyamaka concept of niḥsvabhāva, but also wrote on Buddhist spiritual training, where he reveals his theory of the transformation from ordinary cognition to the liberating cognition of the niḥsvabhāva of all things. Exploring Kamalaśīla’s understanding of the concept of niḥsvabhāva, with a particular focus on his soteriology, will thus shed light on a facet of the Madhyamaka negation of svabhāva in eighth-century India.<br>    
                This presentation will be divided into two parts. In the first part, I will discuss Kamalaśīla’s understanding of <em>niḥsvabhāva</em> as presented in his Madhyamaka philosophical works, primarily the <em>Madhyamakāloka</em> and the <em>Madhyamakālaṃkārapañjikā</em>, in relation to his theory of customary reality (<em>saṃvṛtisatya</em>). I will show that for him <em>niḥsvabhāva</em> means that things, including customary entities (<em>sāṃvṛta</em>), are devoid of the intrinsic nature superimposed (<em></em>samāropita) on them. The second part will deal with his accounts of the meditative practice that brings about the liberating cognition of the <em>niḥsvabhāva</em> of all things in the <em>Bhāvanākramas</em> and the <em>Avikalpapraveśadhāraṇīṭīkā</em>, his commentary on the Mahāyāna sūtra <em>Avikalpapraveśadhāraṇī</em>. In this way, I will show that, according to his soteriology, the Madhyamaka negation of <em>svabhāva</em> does not lead to a nihilistic worldview. On the contrary, together with its soteriological dimension, it offers Buddhist practitioners a way to engage the world positively with the possibility of attaining liberation.

                There is a paradox at the heart of Buddhahood. The Buddha must speak and, in so doing, employ concepts, the which are defined, however, as betokening ignorance. And the Buddha must act and, in so doing, enact karma, the which is defined, however, as suffersome. In this paper, I develop a Buddhist account of Buddahood that does not deny this paradoxicality, but actively embraces it as emblematic of the conditionless condition of the Tathāgata, the Thus Comegone. I draw on the work of Michael Sells regarding apophatic discourse as a “mystical language of unsaying,” applying and adapting this approach to the Madhyamaka philosopher Nāgārjuna (c. 150-250 CE). In so doing, I propose a dual nature to what I term Nāgārjuna’s ‘abelief’, according to which his espousal of emptiness and his eschewal of views are seen as two paths along the same middle way, each attempting to move beyond the unavoidably baleful effects of holding beliefs.

        The Two Truths and Three Minds: How Does Harivarman Believe the Ultimate Can Be Achieved Through The Process of Negation?
        <ul>
          <li class="abstract-button"><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseLin" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">Abstract</a>

              Harivarman, the author of the *<em>Tattvasiddhi-śāstra/*Satyasiddhi-śāstra (Chengshi lun</em> 成實論 T1646, hereafter TS), is a controversial figure, in regard to both his school affiliation and many of his philosophical ideas. This presentation explores one piece of the puzzle of Harivarman’s philosophy as presented in the TS, clarifying his definition of the two truths and the meaning of ultimate truth through a detailed reading of the relevant sections in the primary text.<br>
                First, this presentation introduces two contradictory definitions of the two truths in the TS, referred to as “Definition A” and “Definition B.” “Definition A” regards composite entities as conventional truth and understands both <em>dharmas</em> and <em>nirvāṇa</em> as ultimate truth, while “Definition B” considers both composite entities and <em>dharmas</em> as conventional truth, with only <em>nirvāṇa</em> as ultimate truth. This presentation argues that Harivarman accepts only “Definition B” where <em>dharmas</em> are negated at the ultimate level, and suggests further that Kumārajīva and his translation team might have recognized the divergences between these two definitions and accordingly applied different terms in their translations of the two truths in different contexts.<br>
                Second, the ultimate truth as defined by Harivarman refers to the cessation of three minds: the mind [that apprehends] conventional concepts (<em>*prajñapticitta</em>), the mind [that apprehends] <em>dharmas</em> (*<em>dharmacitta</em>), and the mind [that apprehends] emptiness (*<em>śūnyatācitta</em>). This presentation explores the meanings of these three minds and argues that through the cessation of these three minds, the ultimate truth/reality in Harivarman’s philosophy can be understood as absolute absence, negating even the *<em>śūnyatācitta</em>.<br>
                Third, the *<em>dharmacitta</em> aligns with the definition of ultimate truth in the Sarvāstivāda tradition, while the *<em>śūnyatācitta</em> corresponds with the definition of ultimate truth in the early Madhyamaka tradition, such as in the <em>Akutobhayā</em> and <em>Zhonglun</em> 中論. Thus, this presentation contends that, on the one hand, Harivarman assimilated ideas from both the Sarvāstivāda and early Madhyamaka traditions in his theory of the two truths; on the other hand, he attempts to negate the understandings of ultimate truth in these two scholastic traditions. Through the negation of these understandings, he seeks to establish a new understanding of ultimate truth.

        On Saṅghabhadra’s Theory of Negation

                  Based upon an analysis of understudied passages within his magnum opus, the <em>Nyāyānusāra (Treatise on the Correct Logic of Abhidharma)</em>, this paper examines the Sarvāstivādin Buddhist philosopher Saṅghabhadra’s theory of negation. Saṅghabhadra’s novel theory of negation is predicated upon a realist account of absences, wherein absences, such as negata, are real – albeit negative – entities that can serve as an object of valid cognition. In Saṅghabhadra’s theory, the cognition of an absence, such as the negatum of a negating expression, can provide positive knowledge about reality. For example, when one comprehends the expression “he is a non-brahmin,” one knows that the person being described necessarily belongs to one of the other three social classes (<em>varṇāḥ</em>).  For Saṅghabhadra, negating expressions are of two types: (1) those whose designated object (<em>abhidheya</em>) exists, and (2) those whose designated object does not exist. According to Saṅghabhadra, positive knowledge may be gained from the logically appropriate application of either type of negating expression, because both ascribe specific properties to what is negated, whether those are positive or negative properties. This paper demonstrates how by undergirding his theory of negation on a realist account of the ontological status of absences, Saṅghabhadra distances his Abhidharma doctrinal system from that of his rival, and intellectual sparring partner, Vasubandhu, who views absences as fictitious pseudo-entities that are merely misperceived as real due to cognitive error. It also shows, how by affirming the reality and apprehensibility of absences, and negata as a form of absence, Saṅghabhadra doctrinally situates himself closer to the accounts of the nature and existence of absences found within the Brāhmaṇical Vaiśeṣika tradition, than has previously been recognized.

        Exploring Nor-Arising-Nor-Ceasing: Mahāyāna Sutras' Critique of Sarvāstivādin Teachings

              The teaching of nor-arising-nor-ceasing is one of the most characteristic elements of Mahāyāna sutras, but its meaning, including its origin, is still far from clear. I have previously focused on passages related to the teaching of nor-arising-nor-ceasing within the <em>Vimalakīrtinirdeśa</em> and the <em>Daśabhūmika</em>. I have discussed how passages in those sutras criticize the understanding of nirvana based on the sutra composed by Sarvāstivādins. In this presentation, based on the above result, I will focus on three sutras translated by Dharmarakṣa (T310(3), T460, and T810) that discuss the teaching of nor-arising-nor-ceasing that goes beyond arising and ceasing of dependent origination. They are also involved in the two truths: *paramārtha-satya and *<em>saṁvṛti-satya</em>. Analyzing passages within the *<em>Tattvasiddhi</em> (T1646) and the treatise on Four Noble Truths (T1647), which are only available in Chinese, this presentation will examine the possibility that Mahāyāna Buddhism argued for nor-arising-nor-ceasing in its criticism of Sarvāstivādin, particularly with regard to the understanding of dependent origination and nirvana.
